        <h2>About MS Dhoni</h2>
       <h4> <p class="u">
            Mahendra Singh Dhoni, fondly known as "Mahi" and "Captain Cool," .
            He is one of the greatest cricketers of india.
            He led the Indian cricket team to victories in the 2007 T20 World Cup.
            2011 ICC Cricket World Cup, and 2013 Champions Trophy.
            Dhoni was born on 7 July 1981 in Ranchi, Bihar (now in Jharkhand) in a Hindu Rajput family to Pan Singh and Devaki Devi.
            His parents hailed from Lwali village in Uttar Pradesh (now Uttarakhand) and he was the youngest of three children. His
            family spells the surname as "Dhauni". The spelling "Dhoni" emerged due to a spelling mistake in his school certificates
            and, despite repeated attempts by his family, has never been rectified.
            
            Dhoni did his schooling from DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir, where he started playing football as a goalkeeper, but later
            moved to play cricket on the suggestion of his coach Keshav Banerjee. From 2001 to 2003, Dhoni worked as a Travelling
            Ticket Examiner (TTE) at Kharagpur under South Eastern Railway zone of Indian Railways.
